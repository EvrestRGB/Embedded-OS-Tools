## Tools
I use(d) VIM for Embedded OS development in addition of GCC, GBD and Make.
For them, you need to download the gVIM90.zip file, the GDB and GCC compilers, and Make for Windows. A better option would be to download WSL, the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Bash CLI for Windows. It helps a lot. Also, you will need an Assembly for ARM or x64-86 extesion for VIM in order to use it. Run/Compile ith Make.

```bash
sudo apt-get install gdb
```
```bash
sudo apt-getinstall make
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc && sudo apt-get install mingw
```
